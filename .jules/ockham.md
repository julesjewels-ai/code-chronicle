## 2024-05-22 - [Simplified Git Parsing]
**Observation:** `LocalGitService._parse_git_log` used a verbose loop with explicit list management and string splitting, adding unnecessary cognitive load.
**Action:** Refactored to a single list comprehension using `partition` and `splitlines()`. Reduced method size by 50% while maintaining identical behavior and error handling (skipping malformed lines).

## 2026-01-17 - [Removed Dead Code]
**Observation:** `Commit` data model contained an unused `diff` field, suggesting a feature that was either removed or never implemented (YAGNI). `src/core/engine.py` had an unused `List` import.
**Action:** Removed the `diff` field and `Optional` import from `src/models.py`. Removed unused `List` import from `src/core/engine.py`. Reduced cognitive load by removing misleading code paths.
