## 2024-05-22 - [Simplified Git Parsing]
**Observation:** `LocalGitService._parse_git_log` used a verbose loop with explicit list management and string splitting, adding unnecessary cognitive load.
**Action:** Refactored to a single list comprehension using `partition` and `splitlines()`. Reduced method size by 50% while maintaining identical behavior and error handling (skipping malformed lines).

## 2026-01-17 - [Removed Dead Code]
**Observation:** `Commit` data model contained an unused `diff` field, suggesting a feature that was either removed or never implemented (YAGNI). `src/core/engine.py` had an unused `List` import.
**Action:** Removed the `diff` field and `Optional` import from `src/models.py`. Removed unused `List` import from `src/core/engine.py`. Reduced cognitive load by removing misleading code paths.

## 2026-02-10 - [Modernized Types and Error Handling]
**Observation:** `LocalGitService` used deprecated `typing.List` and swallowed exceptions with a `try/except` block that printed to stdout, creating hidden control flow and side effects.
**Action:** Replaced `List` with `list` (Python 3.9+). Removed `try/except` in `get_commit_history` to allow exceptions to propagate to the caller, simplifying the service and improving error visibility.

## 2026-05-25 - [Removed Dead Code: _parse_git_log]
**Observation:** `LocalGitService` contained a static method `_parse_git_log` that was not used by any method in the class, nor by any external caller. The `get_commit_history` method uses `_parse_commit_from_line` instead.
**Action:** Removed `_parse_git_log` and updated `tests/test_git_service.py` to test `_parse_commit_from_line` directly, preserving test coverage for the parsing logic while removing the dead code.
