# CodeChronicle

An interactive documentation platform that transforms Git repository history into a visual narrative. It uses LLMs to analyze diffs and commit messages, creating a 'story mode' for codebases that helps onboard new developers by explaining not just what the code does, but how and why it evolved that way over time. It can generate video walkthroughs of code evolution for specific features.
